            On July 19th, a massive disruption affected about 8.5 million
            Windows systems due to a problematic update from the cybersecurity
            firm CrowdStrike. This shut down airports, rendered hospitals unable
            to treat patients, lefts banks unable to perform money transactions,
            etc. <br />
            The issue stemmed from a software update crashing the entire
            operating system. This happened because the update was applied at
            the kernel level, which is a critical part of the operating system
            responsible for core functions like managing memory and
            communicating with hardware.

          <h2>What is a kernel ?</h2>
          <p>
            Operating systems use a ring system to bifurcate code into two
            distinct ring, ring 1 is dedicated towards the user where the
            applications run. While ring 0 is dedicated towards the operating
            system. Here important tasks such as talking to the hardware,
            managing memory, scheduling threads and other core functions that
            the operating system provides are stored. Therefore you can get a
            sense of how much control is within the kernel making i very
            redistricted.
          </p>

          <p>
            This brings about a difference when executing faulty code, when code
            in the application crashes the application itself seizes to not
            function, however when code within the kernel crashes the entire
            operating system crashes. Now you can get a sense of what occurred.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may be questioning Why does Crowdstirke have access to their
            kernel if the kernel has such implications over the system. Well
            usually only code that has to be included such as the heat manager,
            thread schedule (A component that decides which threads to run,
            pause or stop) and device drivers that need access to the hardware
            are stored within the kernel. <br />
            That's where Crowdstrike comes into play with their falcon sensor
            and while it is not termed as an anti virus it can be simplified as
            anti malware for servers. Without going to in detail to what exactly
            the Crowdstike software does, suffice to say it needed to be in the
            kernel to operate
          </p>
          <h2>Why was Crowdstike given access to the kernel ?</h2>
          <p>
            Now Microsoft didn't blindly hand them access to the kernel ring,
            companies need to obtain a certificate known as WHQL certification
            which stands for Windows Quality Labs were the driver is thoroughly
            tested by the company themselves and Microsoft to ensure that it is
            compatible with the windows operating system.
          </p>
          <img

            alt=""
          />
          <h6>* Windows Quality Labs Certificate throughout the years</h6>
          <p>
            However crowdstike being an anti malware company needs to release
            updates instantaneously against new and emerging malware that
            frequently pop up. Hence it would be inefficient for them to undergo
            this certification every thing they update their software. Thus,
            according to my understanding, they update the software through
            updating files that are processed by the driver but not actually
            included in them, meaning now there is unsigned code that hasn't
            been fully tested running within kernel mode. <br />
            While we don't know that exactly was the bug that caused the crash
            within the crowdstrike driver we know that it caused that entire
            kernel and hence operating system to crash along with it.
          </p>
          <h2>What can we learn from the incident ?</h2>
          <p>
            Your first reaction may be, "Why do so many windows devices have
            Crowdstrike installed ?" Well public mega cooperations are under
            large pressure to secure their data from hackers and other 3rd
            parties, however a company that has no part in the technology sector
            won't just hire a team of 100 cyber security weirdos. Instead they
            pay a company like Crowdstrike a few million dollars a year to
            handle cyber security. This lead to one company having access to the
            kernel of most fortune 500 companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to shift our attention from the number of crashes to why the
            crash took place in the beginning. From this crash we can deduce
            that the crowd strike software that handles the updates isn't
            resilient with it have inadequate error checking <br />
            Hence the main reason for the large outage falls within the company
            itself and not on the individual programmer. Crowdstirke should have
            put out better quality control for a software that generates
            millions per year.
