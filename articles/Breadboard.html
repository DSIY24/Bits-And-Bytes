            The term “breadboard” harks back to a time when electronics were a
            bit more... <i>hands on</i>. In the early days of electronics,
            hobbyists and engineers would use literal breadboards—wooden boards
            used for cutting and preparing bread—as makeshift platforms for
            their circuits. The holes in these boards were used to hold
            components and wires. This was less about hygiene and more about
            necessity, as purpose-built circuit boards hadn’t yet been invented.

            Early “breadboard” for electronics work, repurposed from actual
            breadboards.

          <p>
            Modern breadboards are made of plastic and features a grid of
            interconnected holes that allow you to insert and connect various
            electronic components without soldering. It retains the name because
            of its origins, even though it’s evolved quite a bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern breadboards are a bit more sophisticated than their wooden
            ancestors.

            The central part of the breadboard is divided into columns of holes.
            Each column is electrically connected, which means components placed
            in the same column are connected together. Like the diagram depicts
            holes along columns are connected together while holes along rows
            are not. Holes can not be connected across the gap present in the
            bread board.
          </p>
          <p>
            However the holes present on either side of the bread board along
            the "+" and "-" strips can connect across both rows and columns.
            These are known as power rails and are long rows on the top and
            bottom of the breadboard, usually marked with red and blue lines.
            They’re used for distributing power to the various components on the
            board.
