            A semi conductor is a material that has more electrical resistance
            than conductors and less than insulators hence it can conduct more
            current than an insulator but less than a conductor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Electrons within any material exists in distinct energy levels
            however within a semiconductor there are two bands. The conduction
            and the valence band. All the electrons are present within the
            valence band however if we increase the temperate and input energy
            into the system electrons will transfer form the valence to the
            conduction band.

          <p>
            This causes the conduction of current in both bands das the
            electrons within the conduction band moves while the electrons
            within the valence band also move to fill the newly created hole,
            this means that the holes move causing the conduction of
            electricity. This type of semi conductor is known as an Intrinsic
            semiconductor.
          </p>
          <p>
            N-type semi conductors are a different type of conductor where
            impurity atoms are placed carefully between the conductor and
            valence band. These atoms have an extra electron and have the same
            energy level as the conduction band.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then conduction only occurs within the conduction band due to the
            flow of atoms. Conduction does not occur in the valence band since
            the electrons are packed and cannot flow. (N-types semi conductors
            are termed as such due to electrons being usually represented by the
            letter n).
          </p>
          <p>
            The last of the 3 semiconductors is called p-type semiconductor.
            Within the semiconductor the impurity atoms are placed near the
            valence band hence causing them to accept the electrons from the
            band which therefore leaves behind holes. Hence the conduction of
            electricity occurs due to the hole movement within the valence band.
            The p in p-type refers to protons since holes are considered to be
            positively charged.

            LED's are constructed from semiconductors. LED stands for light
            emitting diode and are made from an n type and p type materials.
            This then forms an n-p type junction / energy barrier which prevents
            the electrons and holes from moving over the junction.

          <p>
            However if the voltage applied across the diode is increase it would
            compel the electrons to move over the energy barrier there for
            reducing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually when the voltage is high enough the electrons and holes
            begin to flow, this causes a process known as electron hole pair
            recombination to occur. The electrons form the high energy level
            moves down to the lower hole's energy level. This energy is then
            given out as a photon.The energy of the photon is equal to the
            energy gap. Hence different wavelengths of light can be formed based
            on the energy barrier.

          <p>
            LED's only function when current flow in one direction. If the
            direction of current was changed the energy barrier will increase
            hence further preventing the flow of electrons and holes.
