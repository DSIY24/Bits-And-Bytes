            A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and
            managed in a systematic way. Databases allow users and applications
            to efficiently store, retrieve, update, and manage data.
          </p>
          <p>
            A flat file database is a type of database that stores data in a
            single plain text format. (A singular table)
          </p>
          <p>
            It contains records that are usually organized in a tabular format,
            whereeach record on a separate line and fields separated usually by
            commas (CSV Comma Seperated Values) or by tabs (TSV Tab Seperated
            Values).
          </p>
          <p>
            Take for example the database below which features a singular table
            where data is aligned in rows and columns to store data
          </p>
          <img
            src="https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/hnet.com-image7041614564031918492.png"

          <p>
            Flat file databases are mainly used for data storage and retrieval
            and can perform basic data processing and manipulation tasks, such
            as sorting and filtering, using scripts. It is used mainly in small
            scale operations.
          </p>

          <p>
            A relational database, unlike a flat file database contains many
            tables with rows a columns where there are columns / fields linked
            between tables.
          </p>
          <p>Take for example the relational database used in IMDb's website</p>
          <img src="Images/IMDb database.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            In this case there is relationship between the id field in shows and
            the show_id field in ratings. This means that there are
            corresponding values in both columns.
          </p>
          <p>
            However within a relational database there are many types of
            relationships such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                One to one : When each record of the data only appears once in
                both tables. Example a id of a particular movie only appears
                once in the shows table and once in the rating table.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              One to many: When a record can appear multiple times in one of the
              tables. Example a id of a particular movie can only appear once in
              the shows table (as a movie can only have one title, year, episode
              ...) however if can appear multiple times in the genre table as
              one movie can have multiple genres.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Relational databases also include different types of keys that help
            establish relationships between different fields in different
            tables.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Primary key: Is a unique identifier in a table where each value
              within the column is unique.
            </li>
            <li>
              Foreign key: The presence of the values that belong to another
              tables primary key.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Relational databases can retrieve data using SQL queries, which can
            include filtering, sorting, and joining multiple tables due to the
            ability to establish and manage relationships between different
            datasets using foreign keys. It provides a higher level of data
            protection compared to flat files and is used in large scale
            operations
